🌙 Ramadan Coding Night with Python 🐍
Welcome to Ramadan Coding Night with Python, a special coding series where we build simple yet useful projects in Python throughout the month of Ramadan! This initiative focuses on learning, practicing, and applying Python in real-world scenarios while maintaining consistency.

📌 About the Project
This series is designed to strengthen Python programming skills through hands-on projects. We’ll start with simple Python scripts and gradually build practical applications. Since UV Python (MicroPython for ESP32) is also part of this journey, we may explore IoT-based projects as well.

🚀 What You Will Learn
Python basics & scripting
Automating tasks with Python
Working with files & APIs
Simple GUI applications
Introduction to IoT with MicroPython (ESP32)
🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python (Standard & MicroPython)
Tools: Google Colab, VS Code, Arduino IDE
Libraries: Requests, OS, Time, MicroPython modules for ESP32
📅 Schedule
Each night, a new small project will be introduced, covering different Python use cases. The projects will be beginner-friendly, ensuring smooth learning.

🎯 How to Get Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ramadan-coding-night-python.git
Follow along with the project instructions.
Experiment and modify the projects for deeper learning.
